# Features to implement

* Remember UI settings upon restart
* Better column widths
* Show/hide kernel threads
* Move summary toggle to upper line
* (*done*) Double click on a process -- show stat per process: chart for CPU usage by this specific process, memory chart for that specific process; split by kernel and user space
* ctrl+shift+esc should bring forward the window
* Abstract reading information from procfs to make it possible to migrate it to FreeBSD and Solaris
* Memory footprint is quite high -- check what is possible to make it more optimal
* Add name resolution for memory connections (both names and ports)
* Add search by open file (socket or pipe location, etc)
* Add search by remote address/name/port
* Add support for containers
* Make it possible to persist history: to capture certain data over time -- this was actually the initial idea
* Add support for GPU usage stats (not sure what though)
